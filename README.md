# Getting Started with Accessibility

This is a very simple form layout which is intended to get budding front end developers thinking about accessibility and responsive design.

The repository is my solution to the challenge to be used for reference.

Some things to consider:

- Is the solution responsive? Do you have a viewport metatag to handle mobile devices?
- Is it keyboard accessible?
- Is it screen reader accessible?
- Does the form validate? Does the screen reader read out validation errors?
- Does the screen reader read out the asterisk as "star" or "required"?
- Are the colours properly contrasted?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
